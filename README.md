Mountain Car is a classic reinforcement learning problem (solved here with Q-learning) where the objective is to create an algorithm which learns to climb a steep hill to reach the goal marked by a flag. The carâ€™s engine is not powerful enough to drive up the hill without a head start so the car must drive up the left hill to obtain enough momentum to scale the steeper hill to the right and reach the goal.
